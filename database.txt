a single user data is known as document 
and collection of document is known as collection
which we make in mongodb

for eg:
we make collection for messages,
a different collection for users

//Now to connect mongodb with nodejs
we use another package known as mongooose

//use command -> (mongo ) 
to start in terminal
for adding data in database we have to create Schema
than we have to make a Model or making a collection

//instead of then ,we convert function to async
for eg:

app.get("/add", (req,res)=>{

    Message.create({
        name:"Harsh",
        email:"harshrulaniya2001@gmail.com"
    }).then(()=>{
        res.send("Nice Message added");
    })
});

convert to ->
app.get("/add",async (req,res)=>{

    await Message.create({
        name:"Harsh",
        email:"harshrulaniya2001@gmail.com"
    });
    res.send("Nice Message added");
});
